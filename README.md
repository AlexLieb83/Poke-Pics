<strong>How It's Made:</strong>
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a web app using the Pokemon API to display Pokemon information depending on which Pokemon is searched.    

<strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>

Building this site was my first time building something with an API. This project allowed me to experiment with how to communicate with an API and display results to the screen for the client.
I learned about how many APIs are actually out there to build with, and this was a great starting project to learn how to access information from an API fetch.
